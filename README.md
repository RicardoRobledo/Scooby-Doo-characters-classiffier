# üê∂ Scooby-Doo Character Classification using HOG, OpenCV, and SVM  

This project implements an **image classifier** using the **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** feature extraction method and a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to categorize images of **Scooby-Doo characters**.  

<br>

With [SCOOBY DOO CLASSIFICATION DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/esmanurdeli/scooby-doo-classification-dataset) dataset.

<br>

## üîç Overview  
Using the **Scooby-Doo classification dataset**, we apply computer vision techniques with **OpenCV** for preprocessing and feature extraction. Then, we train an **SVM model** to accurately classify images into different character categories.  

<br>

## üõ† Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Main programming language  
- **OpenCV**: Image processing and HOG feature extraction  
- **Scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing and SVM training  
- **Matplotlib**: Image visualization and results analysis  

<br>

## üìå Project Workflow  
1. **Dataset loading and preprocessing**  
2. **Grayscale conversion and HOG feature extraction**  
3. **Label encoding and data preparation**  
4. **Training an SVM classifier using OpenCV**  
5. **Testing and evaluating the model**  
6. **Visualizing predictions and classifier performance**  

<br>

## üìä Expected Outcomes  
- Accurate classification of characters in the dataset  
- Graphical representations of the HOG extraction process  
- Model performance evaluation using classification metrics
